Hello, welcome to my documentation for this assignment.
My character and background choices were mainly inspired by retro and indie game looks as they are quite a great thing to look at when building simple 2D games. 
I used no other tools other than the ones my teacher gave me (the player movement script) and made adjustments from there (the isGrounded variable).
The assets I imported into unity were the portal object, the floor object, the winning screen, the background, and the player, which is all designed by me. (except for the win screen and portal!)
There were no challenges that I faced except for using a 2D template at the start which restricted me, but turning it into a 3D template made it much easier.
